# A HOCON Parser for Node.js

**hocon-parser** is a lightweight and extensible JavaScript parser for [HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md). It can be used as a library or invoked via the CLI. It also supports data transformation (with a pipe "|" symbol) that allows you to transform the data into different types. Developer are free to extend core classes to achieve different parsing behavior.



## Installation

To use hocon-parser as library, go to your project directory and run the following command:

```sh
$ npm install @pushcorn/hocon-parser
```

The parser also comes with a CLI command ``parse-hocon``. Run the following command to install the parser globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g @pushcorn/hocon-parser
```

To parse a config file named ``test.conf``, just use the following command:

```sh
$ parse-hocon test.conf
```

You can also pass the config text to the program with the ``-t`` switch:

```sh
$ parse-hocon -t "a: 1"
```

The output of the command is a formatted JSON object:

```json
{
  "a": 1
}
```
